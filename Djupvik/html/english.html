                <h2>Port of Djupvik</h2>
                <p>
                    The Port of Djupvik is located on the east coast of Gotland very close to the beautiful smaller island Lilla Karlsö.
                     Adjacent to the port is a small and charming fishing-village which, during summer, comes to life with a relaxed and welcoming buzz.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Close by and situated with a fantastic view over the port is Djupvik Hotel, with modern standard and with its own popular restaurant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both the port and the fishing village have a beautiful view of two popular bird islands called “Lilla Karlsö” and “Stora Karlsö”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The coastline south of Djupvik, called “Ekstakusten” is incredibly beautiful and invites to nice scenery and views on foot, by bike or by car.
                </p>
                <p>
                    North, and connected to the port, is a small sandy beach which is well soothed for a nice swim.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The distance from the port to Lilla Karlsö is about 2 nautical miles and it is about twice as long to Stora Karlsö (4nm).
                </p>
